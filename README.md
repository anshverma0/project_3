Welcome to the Weather API project! This repository contains a simple Flask-based weather API that fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap and returns it in JSON format. Users can retrieve weather information for any city, including temperature, description, humidity, pressure, and wind speed, by making a GET request to the API. Quick to set up and easy to use, this project is perfect for learning about API development and integration.
